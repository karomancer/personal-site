						<block style="float:left;display:inline-block">
							Two of my human-computer interaction peers and I explored the difficulties pilots and flight attendants have during their arduous travels. We performed multiple rounds of user research to better understand our problem space and inform our design process. <br /><br /> 

							Our resulting product is an iPhone application prototype that frequent travelers can use to stay engaged with their families. It keeps a constant conversation open between home and the traveler through the idea of tasks called "quests".  Appropriately called Quest, our application idea connects families who are separated by frequent travel by making their travels a more intimate and shared experience. <br /><br />

							<pt>user research</pt><br />
						<block>
							We began our exploration with preliminary user research in the form of <b>contextual interviews</b>, <b>surveys</b>, and <b>social media research</b>. We discovered the primary problem experienced by this audience was a breakdown in communication with family members back at home. Additionally, we learned that a subset of pilots often have layovers in new places with no knowledge of what to see or do, giving us another problem to tackle.  <br /><br />
							In order to better organize our thoughts and to better gain insight into the breakdowns and opportunities in our potential user base, we constructed an <b>affinity diagram</b>. In Human-Computer Interaction, an affinity diagram is a method used to organize a large myriad of notes by grouping similar notes together without predetermining what the groups are. This helps HCI specialists to see patterns that may have not been seen otherwise. <br /><br />
							After constructing these models, we constructed multiple <b>personas</b> to embody different members of our user population. We then began designing a solution to the problem by addressing the needs of these different personas.

							<pt>low-fi prototype</pt><br />
						<block>
							We began our app design with low-fidelity prototyping. First, we constructed <b>paper prototypes</b> on printer paper and presented them to users as a proof-of-concept and flow. The users were then instructed to <b>"think-aloud"</b> as they tested our paper app. Each screen of the app got its own paper page and screens were swapped out as users navigated through the app.  <br /><br />
							After receiving valuable feedback from users and our peers, we made a more interactive version of our paper prototype by constructing the app in <a href="http://balsamiq.com/">Balsamiq</a> and <a href="http://popapp.in/">Prototype-On-Paper (POP)</a>. Balsamiq allows the designer to create a <b>wireframes</b> with the use of standardized UI components while POP allows the designer to import and add links between these screens into an iPhone app for interactive testing. With this newer, more responsive prototype, we made a final low-fidelity prototype for our users to try before tackling the high-fidelity design. <br /><br />
							Our winning prototype was an app that allowed frequent travelers to share experiences through tasks assigned to them by their family and friends back at home. Our feedback suggested that our users enjoyed keeping a conversation open with something playful and interactive.

							<pt>look &amp; feel</pt><br />
						<block>
							Before we could design a high-fidelity prototype, we first had to determine the overall look and feel we wanted for the product. We started this by constructing a <b>moodboard</b>. A moodboard is a design method in which designers aggregate a collection of visual elements that best represent the product they're trying to create. In our case, we wanted our app to look both homey and lively, with a subtle reference back to its airline origins. My team and I found most of our inspiration in pictures of family portraits and flight attendant uniforms. We collected and shared these pictures using a <a href="http://pinterest.com/2kmster2/ixds-quest-app/">Pinterest board</a> and later consolidated them into a physical board. <br /><br />   
							Once we had chosen our colors and "feel", we had to develop a <b>design language</b> and a <b>design specification</b> for the application. A design language describes terms used in the application. For instance, our app revolves around shared tasks, but we didn't want to call them tasks. The word 'task' implies a chore, and why would a person voluntarily do chores while abroad? So we named these tasks "quests", making the user feel like he is doing something more worthwhile and fulfilling. A design specification simply describes the language, fonts, and color choices to developers.<br /><br />

							<pt>high-fi prototype</pt><br />
						<block>
							After determining the look and feel of our application, we set immediately to work. We developed several high-fidelity screens of the application using Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator and tested them on our peers and users. Kelsey and Dave polished up the flow of the application as I constructed the video prototype in Adobe After Effects. <br /><br />
							Our final deliverable was to give a pitch of our product geared toward converting an audience of frequent travelers into users of the product. The pitch described the app's benefits, the reasoning behind the design choices, and why a user should want it. <br /><br />
							The final product can be viewed to the left in the form of a video and a flow diagram. Special thanks to Kelsey and Dave for being the best team members ever. <br /><br />
