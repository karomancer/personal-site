						<block style="float:left;display:inline-block">
						  <a href="http://www.senseplatypus.com" target="_blank">Platypus</a> is a small Pittsburgh-based company that specializes in creating small autonomous airboats that collect and analyze water samples in ponds, lakes and rivers. After collecting samples, the boats send information about the temperature, salinity, pH, and other aspects of the water wirelessly to Platypus&#39; servers. The servers then determine whether there are abnormalities caused by fracking or other means of pollution that would be detrimental toward animals or crops. It then creates a report to send to customers with a breakdown of the quality of the water and suggests causes and actions to take in the case of abnormalities. These findings are presented visually and often come in the form of metric heatmaps. However, all of their services were only available to customers through printed reports sent through the mail.
							<br /><br />
							I and four other Carnegie Mellon Human-Computer Interaction undergraduates acted as design consultants for Platypus. In a semester, we conducted extensive user research using well proven HCI methods, such as Holtzblatt&#39;s <b>Contextual Inquiry</b> techniques, <b>heuristic evaluation</b>, <b>think aloud</b>, <b>web analytics</b>, and more, to determine how to appropriately design an analytics product for their user base. Then we worked together to design and implement an MVP for Platypus to use as a base for their future work on the product.

							Our client&#39;s target customer base includes farmers, environmentalists, and educational groups. Because these groups are so diverse and our time so limited, we decided to focus on the lowest common denominator in water knowledge and access to technology: farmers. <br /><br />
							Using the power of social media, we were able to connect with a timberer in Greene County, Pennsylvania. For our first interview, we ventured through a blizzard to meet him and conduct a <b>contextual interview</b>. We learned that Greene County is plagued by both coal mining and oil drilling companies and that most of the farmers there have little knowledge of how their properties can be damaged by these actions. Our interviewee was different in that he is very concerned with the quality of their water, despite its use being purely recreational. <br /><br />
							In addition to travelling to farms, we also went to the <a href="http://pittsburghpublicmarket.org/" target="_blank"> Pittsburgh Strip District Farmers Market</a> to find a larger variety of other potential users. There, we conducted many interviews to determine farmer&#39;s opinions of and trust in drilling companies, knowledge of water metrics, and access to technology. <br /><br />
							Lastly, we also completed a <b>literary review</b> and <b><a href="competitive_analysis.html" target="_blank"> competitive analysis</a></b>.

							We created four <b>personas</b> whose characteristics vary by degree (e.g. age, tech savviness, knowledge of water metrics, trust and comfort with big industry and government, etc) to help us identify with all members of our diverse user group. We found that the two most important characteristics to our project were probably the degree of tech-savviness and water metric knowledge. <br /><br />
							Instead of shooting for an effective and efficient workflow, we thought that our project afforded us the opportunity to direct our focus on how to appropriately represent data.  In otherwords, we focused on understanding how we could represent data, but gave little attention to how the user navigationally gets to the data. We also presented both the idea of paper and digital water analytics reports to gauge how interactive data dashboards should be. <br /> <br /> 
							Not even the best interaction designers get everything right the first time, which is why it&#39;s of the utmost importance to continually test ideas through <b><a href="think_alouds.html" target="_blank"> think alouds</a></b>. Unfortunately, it was amazingly difficult for us to obtain agricultural workers for this round of user tests; we realize now that you must arrange things weeks in advance because it is hard to contact farmers. Though we only interviewed a handful of farmers, we tried to make it up by testing on people that we thought fit into our four-quadrant solution well, such as a Civil and Environmental Engineering professor and a florist.

							Taking insights from low-fidelity testing, we developed our first interactive prototype using HTML and Backbone.js. We ventured to the Pittsburgh <a href="http://farmtotablepa.com/" target="_blank">Farm to Table Conference</a> to test with new users for fresh ideas and opinions, and tested with a few users from our low-fidelity prototype stage to see if we fixed their original concerns. We used a scenario, which involved users reading an email report from Platypus, and navigating to the dashboard for more information. <br /><br />
							In addition to user testing, we received feedback from our faculty advisors, as well as a peer review session with classmates. We synthesized data from each of these sources into &#39;design suggestions&#39; for our next and final round of design work. The smaller pictures to the left show the evolution of the same page in the first high-fidelity prototype and the second.

								After testing our high-fidelity prototypes, we made minute changes based on our feedback and packaged our code neatly for Platypus to take over. We also prepared a 25 minute presentation and report summarizing our work for the semester for both our clients and a crowd of other Human-Computer Interaction students. <br /><br />
								Our project is not currently live but will be in a few months. If you would like to see a more detailed account of this project, you can view the final report by clicking on the image to the left.<br /><br />
