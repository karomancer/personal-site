							A good friend of mine from high school, Lincoln Race, studies computer science and astrophysics at UC San Diego. He also is very interested in mobile game development, and asked me to produce the graphics for his game <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ctf#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDIxMiwiY29tLmN0ZiJd">Catch the Fruit</a>.  <br /> <br />

							Catch the Fruits is an Android game, available for free, on the Google Play Store. The official desciprtion goes as follows: "In Catch the Fruits, you'll be able to use a touch controlled basket to catch, well, fruits. with 7 currently planned regions and over 50 fruits, there's plenty of content to unlock, all completely free if you're good enough or if you share this app with your Facebook friends via the game."  <br /><br />

							The game includes a variety of graphics, including backgrounds, fruits, and baskets. There are a variety of levels and dozens of fruits. I ended up illustrating many fruit that I never even knew existed! Here's a sample of the illustrations I made for the game.  <br /> <br />

							The first thing to complete is the background designs. I was given preliminary sketches of baskets and backgrounds on which to base the final designs. The game has many different regions, so it was important to give each region its own flavor while still keeping the chosen style for the game.

							In Catch the Fruits, each regional level adds fruit to the total set of fruit that you will have to catch. Additionally, each regional level has a "joke fruit" that you should avoid catching. For example, Hawaii has a humuhumunukunukuapua'a that, if you should catch it, deducts a large number of points from your score.

							In addition to backgrounds and fruit, I had to design the baskets and logo. The logo design was specified by the Catch the Fruits team; I was given a sketch of exactly what they wanted and only had to turn it into a high-resolution SVG. I was also given explicit instructions as to how to approach the basket design. <br /><br />
							Of course, symbols and buttons are another aspect up for the design. The CTF team wanted their buttons and symbols to look bubbly and child-like, like many other mobile games out there. I tried to go for that asthetic, using the blue that they wanted and orange that I thought went well. <br /><br />  
							There still is a lot of work to be done. We are now working on the European and African regions, which includes a few more backgrounds and dozens more fruit. Stay tuned!
