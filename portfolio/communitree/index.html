							How can ubiquitous computing engage and connect people to nature? We set out to answer this question by partnering with the <a href="http://www.pittsburghbotanicgarden.org/" target="_blank">Pittsburgh Botanic Garden</a> to develop a concept for an interactive, ubiquitous art piece. The Pittsburgh Botanic Garden proved to be the perfect place in which to imagine future nature-based technology, as the site is still being developed as a public space. This provides the opportunity to create immersive, innovative experiences not yet seen in botanic gardens. <br /><br />
							Through a user- and garden-centered research process, we developed a concept for an interactive art display. Called the CommuniTree, it is a tree-shaped sculpture with leaves made of polycarbonate tiles. These leaves can change based on community behavior or artists&#39; concepts. We developed scenarios around educating visitors on the areas of the world whose plants are featured in the garden, allowing visitors to share their experiences at the garden, and immersing visitors in stories inspired by the almost magical environment. We picked these themes because they are in line with the garden's mission statement.

							 <b>Note</b>: This is a very abridged version of our process. To see it in full blown detail, visit <a href="http://thecommunitree.tumblr.com/" target="_blank"> our tumblr</a>.<br /><br />
							 We decided to investigate the use of technology to support the outdoor experience. After exploring urban gardens, dog parks, and other outdoor spaces, we ultimately chose to focus on the needs of the Pittsburgh Botanic Garden because the needs and behaviors of the space are still emerging and a UbiComp system could enhance the environment in unexpected ways. <br /><br />
							 We started the ideation process by rapidly developing more than 50 ideas for UbiComp garden systems. In order to help focus our ideas, we used an <b>affinity diagram</b> to identify common audiences or types of activities. We discovered common themes, such as childrens&#39; play, educational games, pathfinding, and adventuring. <br /><br />
							 The team then visited the physical space and interviewed expert tour guide, Frank Gricus. Additionally, we interviewed the garden&#39;s Director of Development, Kitty Vagley. She explained the longterm vision of the garden, including its mission to educate and preserve the land. We presented her with some of our early concepts and got her feedback about the garden&#39;s desire to innovate in the domain.

							We developed 15 storyboards around the groups we discovered during the construction of our affinity diagram, and we did speed dating rounds with three CMU students. Based on their reactions, and the reactions of the director of the Pittsburgh Botanic, we discarded two concepts and refined and combined the rest of our ideas into 11 new storyboards. <br /><br />
							We tested these 11 remaining storyboards on members and visitors of the Phipps Conservatory (a botanical garden) in Pittsburgh. The users we tested ranged in age and ethnicity including small children under the age of ten to senior citizens. <br /><br />
							From their suggestions and feedback, we narrowed down our search to only three options: (1) kiosks stationed around the garden allowing users to gaze into them and see the area from an animal's perspective, (2) a phone application in which visitors and employees of the garden could map out areas that need work and visitors who want to help the garden can use this application to complete work and log it, and (3) an interactive art project in the form of a tree with leaves acting as thin monitors displaying important information about the garden. <br /><br />
							We drafted out the overall experience each of these ideas would bring its users. Of the three, we decided to go with an interactive art project because it was more of a challenge and more creative.

							The best way to illustrate a hypothetical interactive art project that we may not have the technology for yet is through a video. While other groups made video sketches that were composed of a slideshow of images and narration, we decided to try our hands at creating a full blown video with Adobe After Effects. We searched Pittsburgh for a bushy leafless tree and took on four Carnegie Mellon undergraduate students as our actors. We decided to go with a green screen technique using orange panels on our acting tree to use as the interactive panels. To show the versatility of the idea, we also drafted out scripts for three scenarios in which it could be used and directed our actors accordingly.<br /><br />

							Our final product is a video with three scenarios demonstrating our product idea. <br /><br />
							<b>Scenario 1</b> - Three friends are visiting the Asian Gardens in the Pittsburgh Botanic and discover the Communitree. The Communitree's leaves are displaying lightning and heavy rain, so they curiously walk up to its main display to figure out why. They find out that the tree is commonly found in Fukouka, Japan and its sisters in Fukouka are experiencing a thunderstorm at that very moment. Upon tapping the display, the tree hones in on what its sister was experiencing just a week ago; a beautiful, clear sunrise.  <br /><br />
							<b>Scenario 2</b> -  The friends also notice that you can interact with the tree and can use a mobile app to upload pictures to the tree. After uploading a picture of themselves in the garden, the group looks up to the leaves to find their picture amongst all the other pictures uploaded. <br /><br />
							<b>Scenario 3</b> - An artist observes how the friends interact with the tree and comes up with an idea for a new exhibit to program into the Communitree. After sketching up his idea, he brings it to Kitty, the director of the Pittsburgh Botanic. She approves it and people gather for the new story telling exhibit.
