			<div id="aboutMe">
				<span style="font-size:30px;font-family:'Myriad Pro'">Hello!</span> My name is Karina Chow, and I am a recent graduate of Carnegie Mellon University with a degree in <span class="karina">Computer Science</span> and an additional major in <span class="karina">Human-Computer Interaction</span>. Starting August 2013, I will work full-time as a Data Engineer at <span class="karina">Yammer, Inc</span> in San Francisco, CA. 
				<br /><br />

				<!-- My Myers-Briggs is <span class="karina">ENFP</span>, which some say is the profile of an inspirer or an artisan. I'm not totally sold on the inspirer part, but I do consider myself an artisan of sorts. I constantly strive to create and develop, whether it be my own self-defined coding project, company idea, illustration, or scrap-book video. Even when I'm not working on my own projects, I often collaborate with my friends on theirs, often acting as a coding consultant or designer. I am a busy-body; <span class="karina">I cannot sit still.</span>   
				<br /><br />
				I am a first-generation American, born to a <span class="karina">Chinese</span> father and a <span class="karina">German</span> mother. I grew up in <span class="karina">Mountain View, California</span> in a culturally diverse community. My exposure to so many different heritages has piqued my interest in language and culture, so I try to travel abroad whenever possible.   
				<br /><br />
				In my free time, I play video games. I have a special fixation with <span class="karina">The Legend of Zelda</span> and <span class="karina">Guild Wars 2</span>. I also try to stay fit and occasionally play badminton and practice Aikido. <br /><br />
				Last but not least, I love music. I play the <span class="karina">alto saxophone</span> and have always been, and will forever be, a band geek. I am enchanted by the old-fashioned sounds of the 20's and 40's for the depth of emotion they convey. That said, I also love electronic beats. Thus my favorite genre at the moment is electroswing, a hybrid between big band and electronic/techno. -->
